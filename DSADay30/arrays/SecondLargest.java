/*Find Second Smallest and Second Largest Element in an array
Problem Statement: Given an array, 
find the second smallest and second largest element in the array. Print ‘-1’ in the event that either of them doesn’t exist.
Examples
Example 1:
Input:
 [1, 2, 4, 7, 7, 5]  
Output:
  
Second Smallest : 2  
Second Largest : 5  
Explanation:
  The elements are sorted as 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 7.  
Hence, the second smallest element is 2, and the second largest element is 5.

Example 2:
Input:
 [1]  
Output:
  
Second Smallest : -1  
Second Largest : -1  
Explanation:
  Since there is only one element in the array, it is both the largest and smallest element.  
Therefore, there is no second smallest or second largest element present. */
